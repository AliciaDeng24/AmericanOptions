# AmericanOptions
The code is primarily based on the method discussed in below paper: 'Valuing American Option by Simulation: A Simple Least-Squares Approach'. (https://people.math.ethz.ch/~hjfurrer/teaching/LongstaffSchwartzAmericanOptionsLeastSquareMonteCarlo.pdf)
The code will be broken down into several parts:
 - Numerical Estimation using basis functions
 - Determination of Exercise point
 - Backward Computation for fair valuations
